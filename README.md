# Qt Calculator Example 

A simple calculator with a Qt GUI written in C++. 
I wrote this as an exercise in order to learn the Qt library. Most importantly I didn't want to use Qt Designer, everything is done programatically.
Doubles are used for all calculations, this leads to the obvious restrictions and inaccuracies. 
This project uses the QMake build system. 

## Installation

Use '''qmake Calculator.pro''' to generate a Makefile and '''make''' to build the project.

## Usage

Do not use this as a Calculator, unless you don't value percision and work with small numbers :)
