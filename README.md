# Qt Calculator Exercise 

A simple calculator with a Qt GUI written in C++.   
I wrote this as an exercise to learn the Qt library. Most importantly I didn't want to use Qt Designer, everything is done programmatically.  
Doubles are used for all calculations, this leads to obvious restrictions and inaccuracies.  
This project uses the QMake build system.

## Installation

Use ```qmake Calculator.pro``` to generate a Makefile and ```make``` to build the project.

## Usage

Do not use this as a calculator, unless you don't value precision and work with small numbers :)

## License

The app icon was made by me, the same license applies.
